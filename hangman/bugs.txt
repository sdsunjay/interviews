Known bugs

When a letter is guessed correctly, it isn't able to guess the next letter correctly.
For example, the word gym, once it guesses 'y', it isn't able to guess 'g' or
'm'. FIXED (set guess to 1).

When a letter is guessed correctly, it may guess a letter already found in the word, if that is the most common letter for those set of words.
For example, the word are, once it guesses 'a', it will guess 'a' again.FIXED (set guess to 1).

_______________________________________

Use the placement of the letter to get frequency of letters in order to guess.
Does not take into account placement of correct letters already guessed.
For example, if 'a' is guessed correctly and then 'r' is guessed correctly, it
should only look at words containing both those letter placements, not just
'r'.
