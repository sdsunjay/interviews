Known bugs

When a letter is guessed correctly, it isn't able to guess the next letter correctly.
For example, the word gym, once it guesses 'y', it isn't able to guess 'g' or 'm'.

When a letter is guessed correctly, it may guess a letter already found in the word, if that is the most common letter for those set of words.
For example, the word are, once it guesses 'a', it will guess 'a' again.
